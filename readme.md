### Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the client's Redirect URI?**

Most OAuth2 servers should require a whitelist of redirect URIs for security purposes. The Redirect URI provided
by this client is like so:  `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=openid-connect-authorize`

Replace `example.com` with your domain name and path to WordPress.
